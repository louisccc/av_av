This project is about a collection of approaches to augment perception with scene graphs.

We primarily use [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) 0.9.6 which is an open-source autonomous car driving simulator. Besides, we also utilized the [scenario_runner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner) which was designed for CARLA challenge event.

For running CARLA on windows 10, we acquire CARLA windows pre-compiled version from [awesome-CARLA](https://github.com/Amin-Tgz/awesome-CARLA) with this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ptSje3ur6aDaY2qqBYQjiORBLzurxtW1). As for the compiled Python Client side we checkout to the 0.9.6 tag from the official github repository.
