This project is about a collection of approaches to augment perception with scene graphs.

We primarily use [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) 0.9.8 which is an open-source autonomous car driving simulator. Besides, we also utilized the [scenario_runner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner) which was designed for CARLA challenge event.

For running CARLA on windows 10, we download the official compiled version from CARLA [website](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.8).
